This Power BI dashboard titled "World Population Data Analysis (2001-2022)" provides a comprehensive view of global population trends over time. It includes various elements that give insights into total population distribution, gender-specific population figures, and country-wise comparisons. Here's a detailed breakdown of the different sections:

1. Main Summary Metrics (Top Section) based on the filter year 2022. it will change based on the filter
Total Population: Displays a bold figure of the total world population, 8 billion.
Total Male Population: 4 billion, representing half of the total population.
Total Female Population: Another 4 billion, again half of the total population.
Total Female Population (zs): 11,000, denoting a specific category (perhaps a smaller subset or region).
Total Male Population (zs): Also 11,000, corresponding to the female figure in the same category.
2. Top 10 Countries by Total Population (Bar Chart)
A horizontal bar chart ranks the top 10 countries by their total population. The countries included are:
India (IND), China (CHN), USA, Indonesia (IDN), Pakistan (PAK), Nigeria (NGA), Brazil (BRA), Bangladesh (BGD), Russia (RUS), and Mexico (MEX).
The countries are arranged in descending order based on their population sizes, with India leading.
3. Total Female and Male Population (Donut Chart)
A donut chart shows the ratio between the total female population (50.27%) and total male population (49.73%). This visualization highlights the almost equal gender distribution globally.
4. Total Population by Year (Line Chart)
This line chart tracks the total population over the years from 2001 to 2022, showcasing a gradual population increase towards 2022, with minor fluctuations or slowing down.
The line trends downward slightly towards the later years, suggesting some factors (e.g., lower birth rates or other demographic trends).
5. Year Filter (Right Panel)
A vertical list of selectable buttons, one for each year from 2001 to 2022, allows users to filter data and visualize trends for individual years.
Currently, 2022 is selected, which displays the most recent data.
6. Country Filter
A drop-down list on the top right provides the ability to filter data by specific country names, giving users more flexibility to explore country-specific insights.
Purpose & Usage:
This dashboard effectively conveys population trends and gender distribution over time, useful for demographic studies, government planning, or business expansions that require understanding global or country-level population structures. You can upload this dashboard to GitHub as part of a project demonstrating proficiency in data analysis and visualization with Power BI.
